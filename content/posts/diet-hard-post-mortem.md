## Diet Hard – Post Mortem

For the **Gamedev JS Jam 2025**, I submitted my small and slightly silly game called **Diet Hard**.  
The jam’s theme was **“Balance”**, and I decided to participate in the **Phaser** category since I developed the game using **PhaserJS**.

In the overall jam ranking, I placed **180th out of 420** submissions.  
But in the Phaser category, I proudly reached **10th place**, and that already made the whole experience worth it!

Even cooler: **Diet Hard got a mention on the official Phaser website!**

## Concept & Design

This was the first game jam where I actively involved my wife in the brainstorming process.  
We discussed how to translate the theme *Balance* into gameplay — not just a physics mechanic but **a lifestyle balance**.

So we came up with a fun and slightly chaotic concept:

🍏 Healthy food vs 🍔 Junk food falling from above  
⚖️ A balance meter in the center of the screen  
🎯 Try to stay within a balanced diet range!

The player can:

- Move left/right with the arrow keys
- Jump
- Open their mouth with **spacebar** to eat falling food

There are currently **4 levels** — it's still more prototype than full game, but it works and feels fun!

## The Poop Bar 💩 (Yes, really)

One genius (and hilarious) idea from my wife:

> If you eat too much healthy food like plums and broccoli…  
> A **Poop Bar** starts rising in the top-right corner of the screen.

Fill it up? You suffer a penalty!  
Right now the only penalty is moving very slowly, but it already adds a funny twist to the gameplay.

## Music & Audio Fun

I also took the jam as an excuse to make some music in **GarageBand**.  
Silly vibes, cheerful little loops — it all adds to the charm!

And the **Game Over** voice?  
That’s **my wife herself** saying the line.  

Here’s the short **“Game Over”** jingle!

## Final Thoughts

This was a jam full of:

✅ Learning  
✅ Collaboration  
✅ Laughs  
✅ Rapid prototyping  
✅ A surprising celebration of fiber-rich diets 😆

I’m very happy with the results and definitely want to expand the game in the future.  
Huge thanks to my wife for being the funniest and most creative partner ever.

If you give Diet Hard a try, let me know what you think! 🍽️⚖️💩
