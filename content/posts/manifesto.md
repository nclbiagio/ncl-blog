ðŸŽ® **I am**

Hi, Iâ€™m Nicola â€” a web developer with a passion for retro pixel-art games, drawing, and writing stories of all kinds.  
This space is where I share what I build: projects, experiments, mistakes, and everything in between.  
Just curiosity, nothing serious.

My dream is simple: to create a real story with a solid plot.  
Whether it becomes a game, a short story, or something else doesnâ€™t really matter.

If you enjoy pixel art, fantasy and sci-fi worlds, or just like following small but genuine creative journeys â€” welcome.

This blog is my mark.  
Everything else is just noise.
