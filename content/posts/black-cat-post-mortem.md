## 📝 Introduction

This year, something special happened: after years of trying, I finally finished and submitted a game to **js13kGames** — and it felt amazing.

For anyone who’s never heard of it, js13kGames is a yearly web game jam where your entire game must fit in 13 KB zipped.  
No frameworks. No external assets. Just pure, creative, minimal code.  
Oh, and every year there’s a theme — this time it was **“Black Cat.”**

In previous years, I’d always get stuck in the early stages. I had ideas, but they were messy and I’d lose momentum fast.  
But this year was different. This year, I actually finished. And I have to give a lot of credit to my wife — we’ve become a little creative duo, bouncing ideas around until something clicks. ❤️

👉 The game is called **[The Black Cross-Cat](https://js13kgames.com/2025/games/the-black-cross-cat)** — because the cats randomly *cross* the roads, making every level a little more chaotic.

## 🚗 The Game

The idea is simple: each level adds a new road, a car, and a bunch of cats on motorcycles crossing in front of you.

**Your mission:** drive the car to the other side without hitting any cats.  
If you run one over, you lose a life — and a cute but slightly cursed *“bad luck cloud”* ☁️ appears above the car to punish your clumsiness.

These clouds aren’t images — I built them entirely with **particles**, which was way harder than I expected. Getting the look right, making them feel animated and floaty... it was a real challenge, but also one of the parts I learned the most from.

## ✅ What Went Right

- **I finally finished a game.**  
  This was my first time actually completing a jam entry after years of half-baked ideas. That alone is a huge personal win.

- **Creative teamwork.**  
  My wife and I worked together on the concept, and that made the whole experience more fun. We inspire each other in a way that makes ideas grow naturally.

- **Keeping it simple worked.**  
  I didn’t overcomplicate the mechanics. That allowed me to focus on actually polishing and shipping the game — which, for a jam, is everything.

- **I hit my personal goal.**  
  I ranked 41st out of nearly 200 participants, and because I landed in the top 100, I even won a T-shirt 👕.  
  It might sound small, but for me, that’s a huge source of pride. I was aiming for that shirt, and I got it!

## ❌ What Went Wrong

- **No frameworks, just Canvas.**  
  I challenged myself to build everything with the Canvas API. No libraries, no helpers — just vanilla JavaScript. It was rewarding, but definitely slowed me down.

- **Particle effects were tough.**  
  Creating those “bad luck clouds” entirely from particles nearly melted my brain. I hit multiple roadblocks trying to get them to look right without blowing up my file size.

- **The final stretch.**  
  I underestimated how long the last 10% of polish would take. Debugging, adding feedback, tweaking visuals — it all piled up fast.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- **Small and finished beats big and abandoned.**  
  This was a huge mindset shift for me. Shipping something simple feels amazing.

- **Working without frameworks teaches you a lot.**  
  I now understand Canvas so much better. It’s painful sometimes, but it builds real skills.

- **Particle effects are powerful.**  
  Even small touches like my “bad luck clouds” can make the game world feel alive. It’s an area I want to get way better at.

- **A creative partner is priceless.**  
  Building this with my wife made the process joyful, not just stressful. That’s something I want to carry forward.

## 🏁 Conclusion

Participating in **js13kGames 2025** has been a milestone for me.  
I finally finished a project, learned a ton, and even achieved the exact goal I set for myself at the start. I couldn’t be happier with how it turned out.

There’s still so much to learn — especially when it comes to visual effects and polish — but that’s exciting, not discouraging.  
This jam has lit a fire in me to keep making more games.
