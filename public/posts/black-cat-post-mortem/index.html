    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><h2 id="-introduction">📝 Introduction</h2>
<p>This year, something special happened: after years of trying, I finally finished and submitted a game to <strong>js13kGames</strong> — and it felt amazing.</p>
<p>For anyone who’s never heard of it, js13kGames is a yearly web game jam where your entire game must fit in 13 KB zipped.<br>
No frameworks. No external assets. Just pure, creative, minimal code.<br>
Oh, and every year there’s a theme — this time it was <strong>“Black Cat.”</strong></p>
<p>In previous years, I’d always get stuck in the early stages. I had ideas, but they were messy and I’d lose momentum fast.<br>
But this year was different. This year, I actually finished. And I have to give a lot of credit to my wife — we’ve become a little creative duo, bouncing ideas around until something clicks. ❤️</p>
<p>👉 The game is called <strong><a href="https://js13kgames.com/2025/games/the-black-cross-cat">The Black Cross-Cat</a></strong> — because the cats randomly <em>cross</em> the roads, making every level a little more chaotic.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-the-game">🚗 The Game</h2>
<p>The idea is simple: each level adds a new road, a car, and a bunch of cats on motorcycles crossing in front of you.</p>
<p><strong>Your mission:</strong> drive the car to the other side without hitting any cats.<br>
If you run one over, you lose a life — and a cute but slightly cursed <em>“bad luck cloud”</em> ☁️ appears above the car to punish your clumsiness.</p>
<p>These clouds aren’t images — I built them entirely with <strong>particles</strong>, which was way harder than I expected. Getting the look right, making them feel animated and floaty&hellip; it was a real challenge, but also one of the parts I learned the most from.</p>
<p>You can <strong>play the game here:</strong> 👉 <a href="https://js13kgames.com/2025/games/the-black-cross-cat">https://js13kgames.com/2025/games/the-black-cross-cat</a></p>

<h2 id="-what-went-right">✅ What Went Right</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I finally finished a game.</strong><br>
This was my first time actually completing a jam entry after years of half-baked ideas. That alone is a huge personal win.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Creative teamwork.</strong><br>
My wife and I worked together on the concept, and that made the whole experience more fun. We inspire each other in a way that makes ideas grow naturally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keeping it simple worked.</strong><br>
I didn’t overcomplicate the mechanics. That allowed me to focus on actually polishing and shipping the game — which, for a jam, is everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I hit my personal goal.</strong><br>
I ranked 41st out of nearly 200 participants, and because I landed in the top 100, I even won a T-shirt 👕.<br>
It might sound small, but for me, that’s a huge source of pride. I was aiming for that shirt, and I got it!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="-what-went-wrong">❌ What Went Wrong</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>No frameworks, just Canvas.</strong><br>
I challenged myself to build everything with the Canvas API. No libraries, no helpers — just vanilla JavaScript. It was rewarding, but definitely slowed me down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Particle effects were tough.</strong><br>
Creating those “bad luck clouds” entirely from particles nearly melted my brain. I hit multiple roadblocks trying to get them to look right without blowing up my file size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The final stretch.</strong><br>
I underestimated how long the last 10% of polish would take. Debugging, adding feedback, tweaking visuals — it all piled up fast.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="-what-i-learned">🧠 What I Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Small and finished beats big and abandoned.</strong><br>
This was a huge mindset shift for me. Shipping something simple feels amazing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Working without frameworks teaches you a lot.</strong><br>
I now understand Canvas so much better. It’s painful sometimes, but it builds real skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Particle effects are powerful.</strong><br>
Even small touches like my “bad luck clouds” can make the game world feel alive. It’s an area I want to get way better at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A creative partner is priceless.</strong><br>
Building this with my wife made the process joyful, not just stressful. That’s something I want to carry forward.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="-conclusion">🏁 Conclusion</h2>
<p>Participating in <strong>js13kGames 2025</strong> has been a milestone for me.<br>
I finally finished a project, learned a ton, and even achieved the exact goal I set for myself at the start. I couldn’t be happier with how it turned out.</p>
<p>There’s still so much to learn — especially when it comes to visual effects and polish — but that’s exciting, not discouraging.<br>
This jam has lit a fire in me to keep making more games.</p>
